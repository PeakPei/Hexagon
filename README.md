<h1>Hexagon</h1>
<br>
<p>Hexagon is a basic puzzle game that involves the goal of having to
nagivate to the finish block. Its really simple and has no real challenge
however I wanted to share the basic game because it has some basic "level
engine" components that some people MIGHT find interesting.</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li> Level Engine (Parses a text file to generate the level)</li>
	<li> Custom alerts system (Horrible, use something else)
	<li> Game Base (You could design 20 more levels and tie in some UI to have a nice game on the app store</li>
</ul>
